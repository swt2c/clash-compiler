-- TODO: The inclusion of a cabal sdist tarball in the packages list is the
-- unfortunate result of a few things:
--
--   1. fakedata does not support aeson-2.0, so we have to use a fork until
--      support can be upstreamed
--
--   2. cabal does not recursively pull submodules by default (although this
--      was fixed after the 3.6.2.0 release so is not in the wild as of 22-1-3)
--
--   3. cabal from 3.4.0.0 handles 'source-repository-package' dependencies
--      differently, pulling the repo and building the source dist tarball
--
--   4. cabal 3.4.0.0 does not support the 'post-checkout-command' key on
--      'source-repository-package' so we can't pull submodules there
--
-- The combination of these things means for the meantime the source dist
-- tarball is in a fork of the repo and listed in the packages field. This
-- should work as intended on all the version of cabal we use and doesn't lead
-- to weird situations where one version of cabal fails to build clash.
