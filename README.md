Clash is a functional hardware description language that borrows both
its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language
Haskell. The Clash compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to
low-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.

Features of Clash:

  * Strongly typed, but with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both
    safe and fast prototyping using concise descriptions.

  * Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all
    your component without needing to setup a test bench.

  * Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are
    fully parametric by default.

  * Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called
    `Signal`s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.

  * Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.

# Get Clash
Check out [clash-lang.org/install](https://clash-lang.org/install/) to install the latest stable release of Clash, or to setup a Clash project.

# Get Clash from source
Get the source code using [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) and enter the cloned directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:clash-lang/clash-compiler.git

# Alternatively, if you haven't setup SSH keys with GitHub:
# git clone https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler.git

cd clash-compiler
```

To check out a released version, use:

```
git checkout v1.2.3
```

To checkout a release _branch_ use:

```
git checkout 1.2
```

Note that release branches might contain non-released patches.

## GHC compatibility
|      | Linux | Windows | macOS |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| 8.6  | ✔️     | ✔️      | ✔️     |
| 8.8  | ✔️     | ❌      | ✔️     |
| 8.10 | ✔️     | ✔️      | ❌     |
| 9.0  | ✔️     | ✔️      | ✔️     |
| 9.2† | ❌     | ❌      | ❌     |

† GHC 9.2 contains a regression, rendering Clash error messages indecipherable. This change will be reverted in 9.4.

## Cabal
To use Cabal you need both Cabal and GHC installed on your system. We recommend using [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). For more information, see [https://www.haskell.org/downloads/](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/).

To run `clash` use:

```
cabal v2-run --write-ghc-environment-files=always -- clash
```

If this fails, make sure you've got an up-to-date package index:

```
cabal update
```

## Stack
[Install Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) and run:

```
stack run -- clash
```
## Nix
Or [use Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html) to get a shell with the `clash` and `clashi` binaries on your PATH:

```bash
nix-shell
```
